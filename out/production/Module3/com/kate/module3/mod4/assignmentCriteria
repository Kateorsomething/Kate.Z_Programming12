 There is a starter code there that contains a class that
represents baseball player hitting stats.  There is a csv (comma separated value)
file there that already has code to parse it and
create a list of players that is to be sorted.  In the sorting class you will need
 to write a public interface method that calls 5 internal
methods to sort the players based on different criteria.  Use the example of a merge
 sort from the lesson as a starting point.
